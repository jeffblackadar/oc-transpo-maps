# Tips / Instructions

## Best Web Browsers: Chrome, Edge
Many of the more recent maps require large files to load. These maps seem to load in Chrome and Microsoft Edge. Internet Explorer 11 does not work as well.

## Zoom (+ -) / Pan
To zoom in on an area of the map, click the + sign in the top left of the map. To pan or slide the map, move the mouse pointer over the map. The mouse pointer will appear as a hand icon. Click the mouse and drag the hand, which will drag the map.

## Map Features (Layers)
Each map has a list of different mass transit routes or other features such as the urban exent of the city. Each of these is listed on a box in the upper left corner of the map. Another name for this box is the map control panel. Each of the items in the map control panel is also known as a layer. Each layer can be hidden or displayed by clicking its checkbox. Clicking a layer's checkbox twice brings it to the top of the other layers so it can be seen more easily.

## See map data.
Most of the map layers have items that contain data. This data can be shown in a popup window by clicking on a feature of the layer. For example, clicking on the line of a bus route will show the route's number, type and vehicle mode.

## Overlapping routes
Mass transit routes overlap in places. To see a route's full extent, click and re-click appropriate route layer in the map control panel to put the later on top of the others. As an alternative, turn off other layers so you can see one layer more clearly.
